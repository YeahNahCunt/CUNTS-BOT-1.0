# CUNTS BOT 1.0

A discord bot that is just a little project so that I can learn to code as well as utilise in the servers that I own and admin, I may look at making it public but ATM just learning as I go along. 

The bot currently uses "*" as a prefix.

**You can use the `*help` command to know about all available commands**

(I will try to add a feature to change the prefix at a later date, but ATM this should be fine or you can manualy change in the bot.py file)

## **Current features**:

1. Pulls SFW images from meme and gif subreddits (see *help)

2. Pulls NSFW images from diffrent NSFW subs (see *help)

3. Pull IslamQa home page questions (see *help)

4. Some fun SFW games and commands have been added (see *help)


## **Things to fix and I want to add**:

1. Fix " list index out of range " Index error for some subs when it cannot find an image **Current Focus**
            - make it either loop to try again or print error for user to try again **Current Focus**       

2. Add More SFW commands

3. Down the line add Sripture query functions to Bible, Quran, Gurbani etc. (To cater to my server users)

4. Add search functionality to the IsalamQa query **Current Focus**
