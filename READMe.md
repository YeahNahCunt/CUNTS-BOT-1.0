# CUNTS BOT 1.0

A discord bot that is just a little project so that I can learn to code as well as utilise in the servers that I own and admin, I may look at making it public but ATM just learning as I go along. 

The bot currently uses "*" as a prefix.

**You can use the `*help` command to know about all available commands**

(I will try to add a feature to change the prefix at a later date, but ATM this should be fine or you can manualy change in the bot.py file)

## **Current features**:

1. Pulls SFW images from meme and gif subreddits (see *help)

2. Pulls NSFW images from diffrent NSFW subs (see *help)

3. Pull IslamQa home page questions (see *help)

4. Some fun SFW games and commands have been added (see *help)

5. Translate features added to translate other langauges to English or Arabic via a simple reaction (see *help)


## **Things to fix and I want to add**:
     
1. Add More SFW commands

2. Add Sripture query functions to Bible, Quran, Gurbani etc. (To cater to my server users) 
            - Hadiths **Current Focus**

3. Add search functionality to the IsalamQa query **Current Focus**  **So far website is not parsable, attempting alternative avenues**
