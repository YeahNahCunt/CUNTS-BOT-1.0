# CUNTS BOT 1.0

A discord bot that is just a little project so that I can learn to code as well as utilise in the servers that I own and admin, I may look at making it public but ATM just learning as I go along. 

The bot currently uses "." as a prefix.

**You can use the `.help` command to know about all available commands**

(I will try to add a feature to change the prefix at a later date, but ATM this should be fine or you can manualy change in the bot.py file)

## **Current features**:

1. Pulls SFW images from meme and gif subreddits (see .help)

2. Pulls NSFW images from diffrent NSFW subs (see .help)

## **Things to fix and I want to add**:

1. Add multiple alternatives/spellings such as caps etc. to command function (aliases)

2. Fix " list index out of range " Index error for some subs when it cannot find an image
            - make it eithe rloop to try again or print error for user to try again

3. Add Games (8ball, question games etc.)

4. Add More SFW commands

5. Down the line add Sripture query functions to Bible, Quran, Gurbani etc. (To cater to my server users)

6. Simplify code to pull subreddit lists from a .json file ( just makes the code cleaner an deasier to update the lists **(current focus)**
