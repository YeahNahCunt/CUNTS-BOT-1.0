# CUNTS BOT 1.0

A discord bot that is just a little project so that I can learn to code as well as utilise in the servers that I own and admin, I may look at making it public but ATM just learning as I go along. 

The bot currently uses "." as a prefix.

**You can use the `.help` command to know about all available commands**

(I will try to add a feature to change the prefix at a later date, but ATM this should be fine or you can manualy change in the bot.py file)

## **Current features**:

1. Pulls SFW images from meme and gif subreddits (see .help)

2. Pulls NSFW images from diffrent NSFW subs (see .help)

## **Things to fix and I want to add**:

1. Add multiple alternatives/spellings such as caps etc. to command function (aliases)

2. Fix " list index out of range " Index error for some subs when it cannot find an image
            - make it either loop to try again or print error for user to try again
                     
3. And add a "bot is typing..." feature to the bot so user doesnt think bot is malfunctioning while loading content. **Current Focus**       

4. Add Games (8ball, question games etc.)

5. Add More SFW commands

6. Down the line add Sripture query functions to Bible, Quran, Gurbani etc. (To cater to my server users)
